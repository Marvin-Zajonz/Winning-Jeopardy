Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the United States where contestants have to answer questions in order to win money. It has been succesfull for a long time and running for a few decades. <br><br>
Let's pretend we want to compete on Jeopardy and are looking for any edge that can help us to win. Hence, we will be working with a dataset that contains Jeopardy questions from the past and could help us to figure out patterns about the questions. The dataset is called jeopardy.csv and contains 20,000 rows. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/)
